# Keep on Tuckin’

_A protest artwork by Simone Gray (Transwomen in progress) — shared in support of Transgender rights._

## ✊ About This Project

“Keep on Tuckin’” is a protest artwork by me, Simone Grey. It's a personal and political protest artwork created in response to the growing wave of anti-trans legislation and fascist ideology, particularly from the Trump administration and similar movements worldwide. This design is a statement of resilience, pride, and solidarity with the Transgender communityty.

This work is shared freely and publicly to support visibility, conversation, and resistance. It belongs in rallies, on t-shirts, in the streets — wherever we raise our voices.

The artwork draws on two potent symbols of resistance and resilience:

✌️ The Victory Salute — The raised V-shaped hand is historically known as the “V for Victory” gesture, widely used during WWII and later reclaimed by civil rights and anti-war movements in the 1960s and 70s. It remains a defiant sign of endurance and solidarity in the face of oppression.

🚛 “Keep on Truckin’” — The phrase originated in American counterculture during the 1970s, made famous by Robert Crumb’s comic art. It came to represent persistence and optimism — the determination to keep moving forward, no matter the obstacles. By reworking the phrase as “Keep on Tuckin’,” this artwork honors that same spirit of defiant perseverance, now with a transgender twist.

Together, these two references form a powerful visual pun — one that merges humor, cultural history, and protest to affirm that trans people will not be erased. We will keep moving, keep surviving, and keep creating space — unapologetically and on our own terms.

This piece is meant to be shared, worn, and used in protest. It’s a visual rallying cry.

“Keep on Tuckin’”

## 🌈 A Note on Tucking

While the phrase “Keep on Tuckin’” is used here as a defiant and affirming slogan, I want to acknowledge that **tucking is not for everyone** — and it should never be a requirement for Trans identity or womanhood. Every trans person’s expression and relationship with their body is valid. This artwork is not about conformity — it’s about survival, protest, and pride.
