# Keep on Tuckin’

_A protest artwork by Simone Gray — shared in support of Transgender rights._

## ✊ About This Project

“Keep on Tuckin’” is a personal and political protest artwork created in response to the growing wave of anti-trans legislation and fascist ideology, particularly from the Trump administration and similar movements worldwide. This design is a statement of resilience, pride, and solidarity with the Transgender community.

This work is shared freely and publicly to support visibility, conversation, and resistance. It belongs in rallies, on t-shirts, in the streets — wherever we raise our voices.

## 🌈 A Note on Tucking

While the phrase “Keep on Tuckin’” is used here as a defiant and affirming slogan, I want to acknowledge that **tucking is not for everyone** — and it should never be a requirement for Trans identity or womanhood. Every trans person’s expression and relationship with their body is valid. This artwork is not about conformity — it’s about survival, protest, and pride.

## 📸 How to Use
